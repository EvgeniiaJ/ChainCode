                    Project: Chain code for image compression (lossless compression)
                             and object recognition (via) boundary Pattern Analysis


    Abstract:  
    
Given a connected component (CC) labeled image (contains one or more connected components) and 
the corresponding CC property file (i.e., these two files are the output of your connected component project.) 

In the property file, it contains the number of CC in the labeled image, follows by the properties of each CC.  
Properties of each CC are: the cc label, the pixel count, the two points (minRow, minCol) and (maxRow, maxCol) 
representing the bounding box of the object location within the labelled image.  

The chain-code algorithm goes as follows: 
For each cc, we scan the region within the labelled image only those pixels within the bounding box (including
the boarder pixels) until we find the first non-zero pixel, p(i,j), having the same label as cc’s label.  
We mark p(i,j) as the starting pixel.  Then, starting from p(i,j), we trace the cc’s boarder pixels (must have 
the same label as cc), counter-clock-wise; we store the direction (with respect the chain-code direction from 0
to 7) from one boarder pixel to the next until we come to p(i,j).  The process continue until all cc are traced 
and chain codes are produced.
